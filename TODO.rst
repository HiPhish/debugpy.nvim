 Ideas for the plugin

- Have a function which takes a subcommand and arguments, then returns the
  finished configuration. This can be useful for people who don't want to use
  the command, but still want the configuration.
- A `code` subcommand; not very useful for the `:Debugpy` command, but could be
  useful in conjunction with a `configure()` function.
